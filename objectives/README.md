## Learning Objectives

Listed below are the competencies you should demonstrate by the time you've completed each week's work.

### Week 1

* Describe and implement binary search for a sorted collection
* Explain best and worst-case scenarios for binary search
* Determine the number of steps needed to complete binary search in the worst-case scenario
* Explain the difference between different measures of efficiency: constant, linear, logarithmic, polynomial, exponential
* Use big-O notation to describe the efficiency of an algorithm as an upper bound
* Determine the big-O efficiency for basic algorithms with n, n^2, log n time
* Describe big-O as a the growth rate of execution time for a given algorithm as the data set grows

### Week 2

* Describe recursion, including clear definitions of base and recursive cases
* Implement binary search using recursion
* Describe common sorting algorithms, including: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort
* Provide big-O efficiency of each of the sorting algorithms above
* Describe optimal use cases for the given sorting algorithms
* Implement at least two of the given sorting algorithms


### Week 3

* Describe and visualize arrays as contiguous storage structures of fixed size
* Describe drawbacks to using arrays (problems with over/under allocation)
* Describe and visualize linked lists as non-contiguous data structures of flexible size
* Define random and sequential access, along with positives and negatives of each; state which type of access arrays and linked lists allow
* Identify which previously-encountered data structures are either arrays (Java arrays) or linked lists (Python lists, Java ArrayLists)
* Describe efficiency of basic operations for arrays and linked lists in big-O form (read, insert, remove)
* (more on stacks, queues)


### Week 4

* Explain what a hash table is.
* Explain how a hash table is stored in memory.
* Identify the time and space complexity for operations on a hash table.
* Explain how a hash table handles collisions.
* Explain how a hash table resizes itself.

### Week 5

* Explain what a tree is.
* Explain what a binary tree is.
* Explain what a binary search tree is.
* Explain methods of traversing a tree including:
    * Pre-order traversal
    * In-order traversal
    * Post-order traversal

### Week 6

* Explain what a graph is.
* Explain why graphs are useful.
* Explain how to represent a graph in code including:
    * Adjacency Matrix
    * Adjacency List
* Explain how Depth First Search works.
* Explain how Breadth First Search works.
* Explain what a weighted graph is.
